# Security Onion
Security Onion is an all-in-one Security product built to solve your Security infrastructure needs. 
It does not allow for a direct integration, and therefore we suggest connecting to their [Opensearch](https://shuffler.io/apps/b1034dfc80627c08825e53a761fca4cb) instance.
To learn more, <a href="https://shuffler.io/contact">contact us to learn more (free)</a> or try connecting to the Opensearch instance within Security Onion directly.
